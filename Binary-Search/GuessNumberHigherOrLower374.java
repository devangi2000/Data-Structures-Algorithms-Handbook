// We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
// I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
// Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower
//  than your guess.
// You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:
// -1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
// 1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
// 0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).
// Return the number that I picked.

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 10, pick = 6
// Output: 6
// Example 2:
// Input: n = 1, pick = 1
// Output: 1
// Example 3:
// Input: n = 2, pick = 1
// Output: 1
// Example 4:
// Input: n = 2, pick = 2
// Output: 2

// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
// 1 <= pick <= n
