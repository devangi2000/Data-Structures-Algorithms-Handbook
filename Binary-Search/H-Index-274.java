// Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.
// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
// If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.


// Example 1:
// Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
// Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
// Example 2:
// Input: citations = [1,3,1]
// Output: 1 

// Constraints:
// n == citations.length
// 1 <= n <= 5000
// 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

// Method 1
