// You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where 
// the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
// Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 5
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
// Example 2:
// Input: n = 8
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3. 

// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
