// There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.

// The rules of the game are as follows:

// Start at the 1st friend.
// Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
// The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
// If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
// Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
// Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: n = 5, k = 2
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
// 1) Start at friend 1.
// 2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
// 3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
// 4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
// 5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
// 6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
// 7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
// 8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
// 9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.
// Example 2:

// Input: n = 6, k = 5
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. The winner is friend 1.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= k <= n <= 500
