// You are given two numbers A and B. The task is to count the number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B.

// Example 1:

// Input: A = 10, B = 20
// Output: 4
// Explanation:
// A  = 01010
// B  = 10100
// As we can see, the bits of A that need 
// to be flipped are 01010. If we flip 
// these bits, we get 10100, which is B.
// Example 2:

// Input: A = 20, B = 25
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// A  = 10100
// B  = 11001
// As we can see, the bits of A that need 
// to be flipped are 10100. If we flip 
// these bits, we get 11001, which is B.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
// Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

// Constraints:
// 1 â‰¤ A, B â‰¤ 106
