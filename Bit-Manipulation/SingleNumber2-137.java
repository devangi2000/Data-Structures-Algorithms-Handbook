// Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one,
//  which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
// You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
// Output: 3
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
// Output: 99

// Constraints:

// 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
// -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
// Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
