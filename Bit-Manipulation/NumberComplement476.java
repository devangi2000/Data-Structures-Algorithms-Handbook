// The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

// For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
// Given an integer num, return its complement.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: num = 5
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
// Example 2:

// Input: num = 1
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= num < 231
 

// Note: This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
