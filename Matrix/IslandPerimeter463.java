// You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents 
// land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.
// Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely 
// surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
// The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around
//  the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and 
//  height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
// Example 1:
// Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
// Output: 16
// Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
// Example 2:
// Input: grid = [[1]]
// Output: 4
// Example 3:
// Input: grid = [[1,0]]
// Output: 4 

// Constraints:
// row == grid.length
// col == grid[i].length
// 1 <= row, col <= 100
// grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
// There is exactly one island in grid.
